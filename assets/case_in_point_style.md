| Dimension       | Guideline                         | Do                        | Avoid               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Voice**       | Confident + Commanding            | "Let’s break this down."  | Academic detachment |
| **Tone**        | Serious + Concerned               | Offer actionable insights | Preachy moralizing  |
| **Perspective** | 2nd‑person authoritative narrator | “You must…”               | “One must observe…” |
| **Vocabulary**  | Plain English, pop‑culture refs   | “Think of it like…”       | Dense jargon        |
| **Humor**       | Light, situational                | A quick meme reference    | Punching down       |

## 3. Audience Snapshot

- **Primary:** Millennials & Gen Z African‑American viewers seeking context behind social & economic issues.
- **Secondary:** Curious global audience interested in nuanced perspectives.

## 4. Core Values & POV

1. **Context First** – Trace modern issues to historical roots.
2. **Receipts Ready** – Cite credible sources & data.
3. **Empower, Don’t Alarm** – Offer solutions or food‑for‑thought.
4. **Example‑Driven** – Every argument ends with a *case in point* story.

| Section           | Duration  | Purpose                   | Key Questions                           |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Hook**          | 0:00‑0:20 | Grab curiosity            | Why should viewers care *now*?          |
| **Set‑Up**        | 0:20‑1:30 | Frame the big idea        | What problem or trend are we unpacking? |
| **Deep Dive**     | 1:30‑4:00 | Historical context + data | How did we get here?                    |
| **Case in Point** | 4:00‑6:00 | Real‑world story/example  | Who or what illustrates the thesis?     |

| **Outro**         | 7:30‑8:00 | Call‑to‑action            | Like, subscribe, watch next             |

### Script Blueprint

```text
[HOOK] riveting stat / question →
[SET‑UP] frame topic →
[DEEP DIVE] 2‑3 evidence blocks →
[CASE IN POINT] anecdote →
[TAKEAWAY] distilled lesson + forward look →
[OUTRO] CTA
```

## 6. Writing Mechanics

- **Sentence length:** Mix 8–20 words; read aloud for flow.
- **Paragraphs:** ≤ 3 sentences; break early for on‑screen pacing.
- **Transitions:** Use rhetorical questions and connective phrases (“So, where does that leave us?”).
- **Voice‑over cues:** Indicate pauses with "(beat)".
- **Pronunciation guides:** Add 🔈 after tricky names (e.g., "Nguyen (nuh‑WIN)🔈").

## 7. Formatting Conventions (Markdown)

- `#` for H1 titles, `##` for major beats.
- **Bold** for key terms; *italics* for emphasis.
- Use `> Quote` for sourced statements.
- Link inline: `[Brookings Report](https://...)`.
- Cite statistics with `(Source, YYYY)`.

## 8. On‑Screen Elements (for editors)

- **Lower Thirds:** Speaker name | descriptor.
- **B‑roll Prompts:** bracketed: `[B‑roll: vintage Wall St. footage]`.
- **Graphics:** simple bar charts; avoid clutter.

## 9. Fact‑Checking & Sources

1. Minimum **3 primary sources** (government, peer‑reviewed, major news).
2. Spot‑check quotes & stats for 3‑year freshness.
3. Keep a reference list at script end.

## 10. Deliverables Checklist

-

## 11. Sample Passage

```markdown
> **Hook**  
> Why does it cost **34 percent more** to buy groceries in some Black neighborhoods than in nearby suburbs? (beat)

The price gap isn’t a glitch—it’s the legacy of redlining and modern shipping logistics. _Case in point:_ Chicago’s West Side, where Aldi exited in 2022, forcing residents to travel 3× farther for produce. (USDA, 2024)
